# social-network-api

## Description

These routes are meant to be the backend of a basic social media application.

It was built with MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, JavaScript, and Node.js. The npm package used is Day.js.

This code has the functionality to:

- get all users, get one user, post a new user, update a user, and delete a user 
- post to add a new friend to a user's list and delete to remove a friend
- get all thoughts, get one thought, post a new thought, update a thought, and delete a thought
- post a reaction to a thought and delete a reaction to a thought

Through building these different routes, I:

- am starting to develop a better understanding of how to set up models
- have become more familiar writing routes using Mongoose syntax
- gained experience working with 'virtuals'
